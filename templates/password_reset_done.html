    <p>We’ve emailed you instructions for setting your password, if an account exists with the email you entered. You should receive them shortly. If you don’t receive an email, please make sure you’ve entered the address you registered with, and check your spam folder. By design, if you do not have an email address on file with us, there is no way to retrieve your password.</p>
